    "Nuwan Thushara": {
      "About":"With an unorthodox bowling action reminiscent of his legendary countryman Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Thushara has that X-factor as a fast bowler. The Sri Lankan right-arm pacer carries a lot of T20 cricket experience and has also made a superb start to life in T20Is with 26 wickets from 18 games at an excellent average of 16.73. With the ability to trouble batters courtesy of a slingy action, Thushara was acquired by Mumbai Indians (MI) for INR 4.8 Crore ahead of TATA IPL 2024 and was among the wickets more often than not in the games that he played. Now in the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) set-up after being bought by them ahead of IPL 2025, Thushara is part of a star-studded fast-bowling line-up alongside the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, and Lungisani Ngidi.",

      "About":"A towering well-built fast bowler who can consistently bowl at speeds higher than 140kmph - Lungisani Ngidi is a classic South African pacer who can rattle opposition batters. He is not all about express pace, but has proved to be a crafty customer in the shorter formats with effective variations. He won the player-of-the-match award on his international debut in 2017, playing a T20I against Sri Lanka. Since then, Ngidi has been a regular feature of South Africaâ€™s sides across formats, and is one of the few bowlers to boast a bowling average below 30 in all three formats of the game at the international level. The Durban-native picked 11 wickets in seven games at an average of 14.18 during CSKâ€™s 2018 title-winning campaign. Now much more experienced, Ngidi was acquired by RCB for TATA IPL 2025 at his base price of INR 1 Crore.",
